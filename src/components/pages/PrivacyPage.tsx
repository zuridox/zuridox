                We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not
                store your card data on their servers. The data is encrypted
                through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
                (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your purchase transaction
                data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your
                purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase
                transaction information is not saved.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as
                managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint
                effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
                Discover.
                <br />
                <br />
                PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit

              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In general, the third-party providers used by us will only
                collect, use and disclose your information to the extent
                necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to
                us.
                <br />
                <br />
                However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment
                gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their
                own privacy policies in respect to the information we are
                required to provide to them for your purchase-related
                transactions.
                <br />
                <br />
                For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy
                policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal
                information will be handled by these providers.
                <br />
                <br />
                In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in
                or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction
                than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a
                transaction that involves the services of a third-party service
                provider, then your information may become subject to the laws
                of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its
                facilities are located.
